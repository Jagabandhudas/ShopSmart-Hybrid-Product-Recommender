<h1>Sales Recommendation System</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project is designed to provide personalized product recommendations based on customer preferences and product attributes. Using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid approach, the system aims to enhance the shopping experience by suggesting relevant products to users.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset consists of product information and customer ratings from Walmart, including fields like Product ID, Rating, Reviews Count, Product Category, Brand, Name, Description, and Tags. This data allows the system to generate recommendations using a combination of user behavior and product features.</p>

<h3>Key Dataset Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Product Rating:</strong> User rating for each product.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Reviews Count:</strong> Number of reviews for each product.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Category and Brand:</strong> Attributes used to create content-based recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Description and Tags:</strong> Text features processed using NLP for content-based filtering.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong>
        <p>Handled missing values, renamed columns for clarity, and extracted relevant information from product descriptions and tags using NLP (spaCy).</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong>
        <p>Used cosine similarity on user-item matrices for collaborative filtering and TF-IDF vectors for content-based filtering, leveraging product descriptions and tags to capture product characteristics.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Model Implementation:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content-Based Filtering:</strong> Recommends products based on similarity in product descriptions and tags using cosine similarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Filtering:</strong> Recommends products based on user behavior, identifying similar users and recommending items they have interacted with.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Model:</strong> Combines results from both collaborative and content-based filtering to provide well-rounded recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation and Testing:</strong>
        <p>Tested the recommendation system with various user inputs to ensure relevance and accuracy. The top-rated and most frequently recommended products are highlighted for easy interpretation.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Top-Rated Products:</strong> Identified by averaging ratings across different users.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Specific Recommendations:</strong> Generated through collaborative and content-based approaches to enhance personalization.</li>
    <li><strong>Hybrid Recommendations:</strong> Combines content-based and collaborative methods, leading to a more accurate and diverse recommendation list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This Sales Recommendation System demonstrates how machine learning and natural language processing can improve e-commerce personalization. By leveraging collaborative, content-based, and hybrid recommendation methods, the system provides relevant and dynamic product suggestions that can enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.</p>
